# Shortest Path Finder Using Dijkstra's Algorithm
This repository contains a Java implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. Dijkstra's Algorithm efficiently computes the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in the graph, making it suitable for applications like network routing and geographic mapping.

# Overview
Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source node to a destination node in a graph with non-negative weights. 
This implementation includes:

1- Graph Representation: The graph is represented using an adjacency list with weighted edges.

2- Shortest Path Calculation: The algorithm calculates the shortest path from the source node to the destination node.

3- Path Reconstruction: Displays the shortest path and the total distance from the source to the destination.

# Features
1- Efficient Pathfinding: Computes the shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is suitable for graphs with non-negative weights.

2- Graph Visualization: Provides a clear representation of the graph with nodes and weighted edges.

3- Detailed Output: Outputs the shortest path and the total distance between the source and destination nodes.
